# DIYAnalogSynth
Arduino code for my DIY digitally controlled analog synthesiser.

## What is this project?

Since around 2018, I have been working on building myself a digitally controlled analog syntehsiser. When I initially began the project, I had no knowledge of sound synthesis or electronics and used this project as a way to teach myself the principles of each. The first few years of the project were learning arduino and basic electonics. I then began to design my own schematics on breadboards.

## What is a Digitally Controlled Analog Synthesizer?

Over the course of the 70s, there was a push to recreate the sounds of instruments using electronic circuits. This led to the design of the analog synthesizer. Built entirely of common electronic components, such as transistors and resistors, the analog synthesier was able to manipulate fundamental wave forms to create sounds that resembled those of instruments. However, there were two major issues that inconvenienced users.

1) First is the lack of basic features such as saving and loading presets. 

2) Second is the difficulty to keep the instrument in tune.

The digitally controlled analog synthesiser solved these challenges by using a digital computer interface to control the analog circuits.
